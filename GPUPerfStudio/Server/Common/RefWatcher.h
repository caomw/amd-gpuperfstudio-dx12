/*
   ** About enabling/disabling the RefWatch **

   It's hard to tell when to enable or disable the RefWatcher, it has more to do with the game
   itself than with the DEBUG/RELEASE build. Also its bad to have it off all the time and having
   it on in some games can be annoying.

   So here is a rule of thumb, when you are working on the HUD on a simple app is good to have
   them on once you don’t have any leaks, you can turn them off.

   I'll add a macro anyway that by default will be off, but please turn it on if you are working
   on the HUD
